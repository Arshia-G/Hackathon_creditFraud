## Fraud Detection System

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a robust fraud detection system using advanced machine learning techniques. The system aims to identify fraudulent transactions in real-time, ensuring the security and integrity of financial operations. By analyzing various transaction attributes and employing a logistic regression model, we provide a reliable and efficient solution for detecting fraudulent activities.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
- mermaid.ai
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Features
- Real-time transaction data input via a web interface.
- Predicts the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent.
- Alerts administrators when a fraudulent transaction is detected.
- Utilizes logistic regression for accurate predictions.

## Dataset
I utilized datasets from [YouData.ai] for training and testing the machine learning model.
